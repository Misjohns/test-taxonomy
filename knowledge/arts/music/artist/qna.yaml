  - context: >-
      He studied art, music and design before embarking on a professional career
      as a musician in 1963. He released a string of unsuccessful singles with
      local bands and a self-titled solo album (1967) before achieving his first
      top-five entry on the UK singles chart with "Space Oddity" (1969). After a
      period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era
      with the flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The
      character was spearheaded by the success of the single "Starman" and its
      album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (both
      1972), which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted
      towards a sound he characterised as "plastic soul", initially alienating
      many of his UK fans but garnering his first major US crossover success
      with the number-one single "Fame" and the album Young Americans (both
      1975). In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film The Man Who Fell to Earth
      and released Station to Station. In 1977, he again changed direction with
      the electronic-inflected album Low, the first of three collaborations with
      Brian Eno that came to be known as the Berlin Trilogy. "Heroes" (1977) and
      Lodger (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top-five and received
      lasting critical praise.


      After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had three
      number-one hits: the 1980 single "Ashes to Ashes", its album Scary
      Monsters (and Super Creeps) and "Under Pressure" (a 1981 collaboration
      with Queen). He achieved his greatest commercial success in the 1980s with
      Let's Dance (1983). Between 1988 and 1992, he fronted the hard rock band
      Tin Machine before resuming his solo career in 1993. Throughout the 1990s
      and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including
      industrial and jungle. He also continued acting; his roles included Major
      Jack Celliers in Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (1983), Jareth the Goblin
      King in Labyrinth (1986), Phillip Jeffries in Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with
      Me (1992), Andy Warhol in the biopic Basquiat (1996), and Nikola Tesla in
      The Prestige (2006), among other film and television appearances and
      cameos. He ceased touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at
      a charity event in 2006. He returned from a decade-long recording hiatus
      in 2013 with The Next Day and remained musically active until his death
      from liver cancer in 2016. He died two days after both his 69th birthday
      and the release of his final album, Blackstar.


      During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at over 100 million
      worldwide, made him one of the best-selling musicians of all time. He is
      the recipient of numerous accolades, including six Grammy Awards and four
      Brit Awards. Often dubbed the "chameleon of rock" due to his continual
      musical reinventions, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
      in 1996. Rolling Stone ranked him among the greatest singers, songwriters
      and artists of all time. As of 2022, Bowie was the best-selling vinyl
      artist of the 21st century.
